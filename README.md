# Solr Search for NodeBB

**Use the [main plugin](https://github.com/julianlam/nodebb-plugin-solr). I'm now helping to maintain it. All changes of the cppnet branch have been merged into the main plugin.**

[From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Solr):
> Solr (pronounced "solar") is an open source enterprise search platform from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database integration, and rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling.

This plugin extends NodeBB to utilise an installation of Apache Solr as a search backend.

## Configuration

1. Install this plugin via npm: `npm install nodebb-plugin-cppnet-solr`
1. Activate it in the Plugins page
1. Restart NodeBB
1. Check that the plugin has successfully connected to the search engine. If not, adjust as necessary.

## Installation

    npm install nodebb-plugin-cppnet-solr
